### How to get tided data 

1. Run GetData.R script (typing source("GetData.R") in R-console). This script will download archieve https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip , extract it into current directory. Therefor now we have folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in current directory created.
2. Run run_analysis.R script. This script will load load two datasets (train and test) into memory, merge them, select necessaty columns and form tided data.
3. Tided data are persisted in file "TidyData.txt"

If you have already downloaded archieve from WEB-site you can skip step 1 and just run run_analysis.R script.
