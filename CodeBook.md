###Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

##Study design
The results of Samsung  experiment were downloaded from WEB-site by URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
The data were extracted from ZIP archeve into current directory.

I used script "GetData.R" for downloading and extraction. 

After the script finished it work, we have folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in working directory
The structure is:
```

UCI HAR Dataset
               \train
                     \X_train.txt			-- this file contains the results of measurements
                     \Y_train.txt			-- this file contains the IDs of activities performed by volunteers 
                     \subject_train.txt		-- IDs of volunteers
               \test
                     \X_test.txt			-- this file contains the results of measurements
                     \Y_test.txt			-- this file contains the IDs of activities performed by volunteers 
                     \subject_test.txt		-- IDs of volunteers
                     \activity_labels.txt			-- List of activities
                     \features.txt			   	-- IDs of volunteers who took part in experiments
```                     

What do we do with data?
* load test & train data set and Y-values, load list of volunteers
* create matching between activity IDs and the names of activities (merge two data sets)
* load reference data (list of activities)
* select only colunms which names contain "mean" or "std" - mean value or standard deviation - from merged test & train data set
* Create data frame which contains: 
- ID of person who performed the experiment;
- the name of activity
- the results of measurement (from previous Item)
- Create data frame which contains the averaged values from previous step (grouped by Subject and ActivityName)
* write data frame into file

##Code book
```
* test_X - 2947 x 651 data.frame - test data set
* test_Y - 2947 x 1 data.frame - test Y-values (IDs of activities)
* train_X - 7352 x 561 data.frame - train data set
* train_Y - 7352 x 1 data.frame - train Y-values (IDs of activities)
* fullDS - 10299 x 561 data.frame - contains a combination of test & train data sets
* full_Y - 10299 x 1 data.frame - contains a combination of test & train Y-values (IDs of activities)
* subject_test - 2947 x 1 data.frame - testing IDs of volunteers who performed the test
* subject_train - 7352 x 1 data.frame - training IDs of volunteers who performed the test
* subjects_all - 10299 x 1 data.frame - combination of test and train IDs of volunteers
* activities - list of activities
* fts - 561 x 1 data.frame - list of features
col_ids - 79 x 2 data.frame - IDs of columnts which contains either "mean" or "std" - mean or standart deviation measurements
res - 10299 x 81 data.frame - full final data set
avg_res - 180 x 81 data.frame - contains averaded values from data frame "res"
